## Projects

### 1. Bank Project
The **Bank Project** simulates basic banking operations, allowing users to perform various transactions. The key functionalities implemented in this project are:

- **Create Account**: Allows the user to create a new bank account with a unique account number.
- **Deposit Money**: Enables the user to deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Allows the user to withdraw money from their account, ensuring sufficient balance.
- **Check Balance**: Displays the current balance of the user's account.

This project uses basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including classes and methods, to structure the application. It also implements basic input and output handling to make it interactive.
