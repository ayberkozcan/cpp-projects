## Projects

### 1. Bank Project
The **Bank Project** simulates basic banking operations, allowing users to perform various transactions. The key functionalities implemented in this project are:

- **Create Account**: Allows the user to create a new bank account with a unique account number.
- **Deposit Money**: Enables the user to deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Allows the user to withdraw money from their account, ensuring sufficient balance.
- **Check Balance**: Displays the current balance of the user's account.

This project uses basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including classes and methods, to structure the application. It also implements basic input and output handling to make it interactive.

### 2. To Do
The To-Do List Application manages tasks with features like adding, editing, deleting, and saving tasks to a file (notes.txt). Key functionalities include:

- **Load Tasks**: Reads tasks from a file, if available.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Tasks**: Allows users to manage tasks interactively.
- **Save Changes**: Updates the file to persist changes.

This project demonstrates file handling, dynamic task management using std::vector, and a menu-driven structure with basic error handling.
